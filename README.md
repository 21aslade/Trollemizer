# Trollemizer
This project is a standalone add-on to the ALttP VT Randomizer that aims to make the game as annoying as possible.
Currently, it has 4 features: Turtle Rock Peg Order randomization, Item GFX randomization (which is currently visually bugged), Bomb Fuse Timer Randomization, and Super Lonk Mode.

Most of those are fairly straightforward, but Super Lonk Mode is more unintuitive.
When it is enabled, using the item menu (pressing enter) will toggle between Lonk mode and Superbunny mode. In Lonk mode, only Y-button items can be used (boots can be used for a single frame to allow hookdashing). In Superbunny mode, Link can only use his sword and boots, with Y-button items being unavailable to him. (Link's graphics do not currently change in superbunny mode.)
